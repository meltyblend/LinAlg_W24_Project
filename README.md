This is a linear algebra project that I am doing (or did) during the winter of 2024
started on December 5th, 2024


As of current I have added the following functions. (there is no real specific order to which I am adding
each function as I kinda shoved in a row echelon form and row reduced echelon form checker in there just today 
as I believe it would be beneficial for me when I do decide to add a function for Gaussian-Jordan elimination
and to find the inverse of a matrix)

There are a lot of other things I could add to this project for instance optimizing the code. 
Learning Fast Matrix Multiplication, but the real idea of the project is to present my knowledge and love of 
linear algebra combined with my love of coding. 

I will attempt to add some of the following like Fast Matrix Multiplication and LU Decomposition in the near future.

Completed:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. vector addition
2. vector subtraction
3. dot products (I want to implment the ability to find the angle between two vectors)
4. Scalar multiplicatoin on vectors
5. Matrix Addition
6. Matrix Subtraction
7. Matrix Multiplication (In the future I will learn Fast Matrix Multiplication Implementation)
8. Row Echelon Form Checker 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Progress:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Row Reduced Echelon Form Checker
2. Transpose of a matrix
3. Trace of a matrix
4. Determinant of a matrix
5. Gaussian Elimination (Possibly implementing LU decomposition, which is very new to me)
6. Finding the inverse of a matrix
7. Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
